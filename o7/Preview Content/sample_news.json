      "body":"\u003Cp\u003EFederal news channels have announced that the wedding of Princess Aisling Duval and Ambassador Jordan Rochester has been cancelled.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe statement came from Congress member Isolde Rochester:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u201cThe planned wedding between my son Jordan Rochester and Her Imperial Highness will no longer take place. We have contacted everyone involved with the event and closed down all related projects.\u201d\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe announcement follows anti-slavery campaigner Jarl Toredo\u2019s confession that he and Aisling Duval were romantically involved for several months. Toredo also claimed that the planned marriage was purely a political matter.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe cancellation was confirmed by the Imperial Palace on Emerald, but there has been no direct response from Princess Duval or Ambassador Rochester.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nPolitical journalist Cassia Carvalho of The Imperial Herald commented:\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u201cThe fact that this news comes from Isolde Rochester gives weight to Jarl Toredo\u2019s claims. If the marriage was a political scheme, that may explain why the Rochester family matriarch is the one to call it off, no longer trusting Princess Duval to play her part. Or perhaps this is simply the reaction of a mother, enraged at her future daughter-in-law\u2019s infidelity.\u201d\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n\u201cHad the marriage taken place, would it have initiated an era of Federal-Imperial cooperation, or triggered a new wave of conflict? It seems we will never know.\u201d\u003C\/p\u003E\n",
